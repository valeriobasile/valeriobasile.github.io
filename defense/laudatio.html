I am happy to accept the task assigned to me by the Rector
Magnificus. However, before performing this task, I would like to
address a few personal words to you.
</p>
<p>
Dear Valerio,
</p>
<p>
You were born in Naples, Italy. And now you're standing here in
Groningen, the Netherlands. Arguably, Groningen has not much in common
with naples, except that people drive their bicycles in Groningen as
they do cars in Naples: with creative use of the traffic rules. So a
sensible question to ask is what brought you here, and why you are
dressed in a suit and performing these amusing but well-coordinated
bows to us.
</p>
<p>
In order to answer that question we have to go back five years in
time, to an Italian city nicknamed *la rossa, la grassa*:
Bologna. What not many people know is that for a while you and i lived
in the same street, Via Nosadella, right in the historical center of
Bologna. At the time I was building my new team in Groningen. With
your computer science background I knew you would make an excellent
member of the group. So the job interview that brought you to
Groningen was conveniently conducted in a coffee bar in the same Via
Nosadella. And I made you an offer---as they say in southern
Italy---that you couldn't refuse. And indeed, you didn't.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to your first months in Groningen. You were joining us
daily for lunch, slowly getting used to eating ham-and-cheese
sandwiches, instead of freshly-made *tortellini in brodo* or *pizza al
taglio*. When you informed your family in Italy about the food
situation in the Netherlands you were sent a large box of Italian food
every month: hand-made pasta, tartufi, extra-virgin olive-oil, and
other delicacies. The good news was that you often shared this with us
while showing off your cooking skills, in particular those that
contributed to your *pasta al forno*.
</p>
<p>
In the eventful years that you were here in Groningen, you were
working on generating text from logic-based meaning representations,
by first developing a large annotated corpus of texts followed by
ingestigating novel approaches for generating text from meaning
representations. Soon it became clear how hard this problem was. Many
problems you have solved, and many new ones arised, and I think that
is a sign of good science. In fact, much of your research has been
published and cited by many scholars around the world already. So I
was confident you would easily find a follow-up job, and indeed you're
now a postdoc in France.
</p>
<p>
Your computer science expertise was very useful and appreciated in the
group. But there were some other qualities that made you a special
person. I already mentioned that people in Napels have creative
skills. Perhaps that's where your imagination is coming from. You had
a big influence on *wordrobe*, the game with a purpose that we
designed together early in the project. Your graphical design
abilitiesgave us beautiful logo's for the software that we developed
and the conferences that we organized. You made a wonderful one-minute
video about our research that nearly won a prize. And you banned
bullet points from your presentation slides and applied the principle
of minimalism to them as well. I myself was influenced by these ideas
and look at the result today: no bullet points, not even slides!
</p>
<p>
One more thing. The stereotypical computer scientist can perhaps be
described as an anti-social geek. But you are definitely not one of
them, even though you play a lot of minecraft (some say too much) and
entertain yourself by memorizing hundreds of cryptical linux
commands. Your social engagement with people from other strands of
research has put you in touch with various disciplines, including
journalism studies, social media research, and legal informatics. This
is exceptional, and tells a lot about your personality.
</p>
<p>
Dear Valerio, I tried to generate this speech from a logical form, but
I can hardly find any logical coherence in my laudatio. So it is
probably a good idea for me, for you, and the audience, to start the
preparation of the final notes. Very soon you will become doctor, and
I have the great honor to be the first to congratulate you.
</p>

<pre>
[*When this is finished, the primary supervisor puts his cap back
  on, invites everyone to stand and, when everyone has risen, speaks
  the following words*]
</pre>

<p>
By virtue of the powers vested in us by Dutch law, in accordance with
the decision of the College of Deans of this University, I, Johannes
Bos, confer on you, Valerio Basile, the title of doctor and all the
rights associated by Dutch law or custom with a PhD degree at the
University of Groningen. Do you as a Doctor promise to act in
accordance with the Netherlads Code of Conduct for Scientific
Practice?
</p>

<pre>
The PhD candidate replies: I promise.
</pre>

<p>
Please take your seats again.
</p>

<p>
Now that I have performed the task assigned to me, let me be the first
to congratulate you on your PhD degree and to address you as Doctor.
