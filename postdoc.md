The [Content-Centered Computing](https://www.cs.unito.it/do/gruppi.pl/Show?_id=453y) group at the University of Turin, Italy, offers **two 14-month postdoc positions** in the context of HARMONIA (Harmony in Hybrid Decision-Making: Knowledge-enhanced Perspective-taking LLMs for Inclusive Decision-Making), funded by the European Union under the NextGenerationEU program within the larger project FAIR (Future Artificial Intelligence) [Spoke 2 "Integrative AI"](href="https://fair.fbk.eu/). The project aims at developing methods for the adoption of knowledge-enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) in supporting informed and inclusive political decisions within public decision-making processes.

The topics of the postdoc fellowships are:
- Computational linguistics methods for knowledge-enhanced perspective-taking LLMs to support Inclusive Decision-Making
- Perspective-taking LLMs for supporting Inclusive Decision-Making
(full descriptions below)

The team includes members of the Computer Science Department and Economics and Statistics Department of the University of Turin.
A PhD in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, or related areas is highly recommended. Knowledge of Italian is not mandatory.
The deadline for application is **May 13th 2024**. 

The gross salary is €25.328 (about €1,860/month net salary). [Turin](https://www.turismotorino.org/en/territory/torino-metropoli/torino) is a vibrant and liveable city in Northern Italy, close to the beautiful Italian Alps and with a [manageable cost of living](https://en.unito.it/living-turin/when-you-arrive/cost-living-turin).

**Computational linguistics methods for knowledge-enhanced perspective-taking LLMs to support Inclusive Decision-Making**

The activity will focus on a) design of a semantic model to represent sinteractions between urban services and citizens and integrate multi-source hybrid data; b) data annotation by citizens with different socio-cultural backgrounds to collect different perspectives on social issues. Data will be collected and organized in a Knowledge Graph. The activity will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts in KR, behavioral economics and LLMs (link with the design of knowledge-enhanced LLMs).

**Perspective-taking LLMs for supporting Inclusive Decision-Making**

The activity will focus on a) exploring techniques for integrating multi-source hybrid citizen data into LLMs (RAG and Knowledge Injection); b) developing methods for training and evaluating perspective-taking LLMs, which explicitly encode multiple perspectives, embodying the point of view of different citizen communities on a topic. Planned activities include: benchmark creation, error analysis, and evaluation of the efficiency and reliability of the developed technologies.
