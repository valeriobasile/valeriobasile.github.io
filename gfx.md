**Disclaimer:** I am **not** a trained graphic designer, by any
  means. Every work of design that is meant for publication should
  **always** be realized by professionals.

That said, this is a gallery of works made by me, mostly logos. I like
working on logos because it involves a good deal of conceptualization,
while keeping the actual illustration work to a manageable intensity.
The bare minimum material to ship a logo should include at least an
icon version, a monochromatic version, and a version for dark
background.

Logos
-----

![Groningen Meaning Bank](gmb.png)

A free semantically annotated corpus that anyone can edit.

The logo hints at the logical formulas used in the project with the
logical symbols ∀ (universal quantifier) and ∃ (existential
quantifier). The font is of the typewriter type, which fit the idea of
a corpus of *written text*. The circle is a symbol of completeness
(even though it's open in the logo). Orange is the color of the
Netherlands.

![Parallel Meaning Bank](pmb.png)

A free semantically annotated **parallel** corpus (English, Dutch,
German, and Italian).

Derived from the GMB logo, the cirls is modified to symbolize the
parallelism (parallel bands, that was easy). The color is the inverse
of the GMB logo.

![TWITA](twita.png)

Collection of tweets identified as being written in the Italian
langauge.

The logo is inspired by the Twitter fonts and the colors hints at the
Italian flag.

![Produce](produce.png)

Produce is a Python-powered automation tool geared towards management
of processes that deal with many files.

This logo plays on the
[homography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph) of *produce* as
verb (create or manufacture) and *produce* as a noun (fresh fruits and
vegetable grown for the market). While the intended meaning of the
software is the former, the logo contains a stylized tomato.

![Elephant logo](elephant.png)

Word and sentence boundary detection software (a *tokenizer*, that
is), based on supervised statistical methods.

The name of the software refers to the [elephant in the room
metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room). Accordingly,
the logo includes an elephant head.

![NLDB logo](nldb.png)

International conference on Applications of Natural Language
Processing to Information Systems.

The color scheme matches the one of the [University of
Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/), where the event was hosted. This logo
ended up on the conference bags as well.

![Socialpros logo](socialpros.png)

Socialpros (Social Project Studio) is a startup focused on social
research software development. It somehow lose momentum.

The logo contains a representation of a network, a formalism to
represent many important phenomena in social sciences. It is also
shaped like a rising sun, as socialpros is a *new* company on
the horizon.
