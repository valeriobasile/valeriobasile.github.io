title: Pastasciutta
---

*Pastasciutta* is a [crasi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasis) of
 "pasta" and "asciutta" ("dry"), which is a kind of contradiction,
 because pastasciutta is not dry at all. Rather, it is basic pasta
 with tomato sauce, easy to make and the default lunch meal for
 millions of students and single guys around Italy.

Though being a simple recipe, Italians can fight (verbally) for hours
about the right ingredients and preparation, like we do with the
*caff√©* (moka espresso) and pretty much anything culinary. That said,
this is **my** version of pastasciutta, this is how I like it and how
it should be made, period.

Ingredients
===========

For four people:

- 500g pasta. All types of pasta are good, I personally prefer short
  pasta with tomato sauce
- half a liter (at least) of tomato *passata*
- half onion
- olive oil
- salt
- oregano
- (optional) parmigiano cheese

Tools
===========

You will need:

- a small pot for the sugo (possibly with a lid)
- a large pot for the pasta (possibly with a lid)
- one or two wooden spoons
- a colandaer
- (optional) a grater

The sauce
=========

*Sugo* is Italian for *sauce*, but in colloquial Italian, *sugo*
 typically refers to tomato sauce, unless different ingredients are
 specified. In fact, *pasta al sugo* is a synonym of *pastasciutta*.

How to make the *sugo*:

Pour some olive oil in a small pot, add the chopped down onion, and turn
on the fire. This is called *soffritto*. When the onions turn golden,
pour the passata in the pot and stir. After a while you will want to
lower the fire and half-cover the pot, otherwise tomato sauce will go
everywhere in your kitchen. Add salt and oregano, and if the level
reduces too much add a little water now and then.

The pasta
=========

Fill a large pot with water, add salt and heat to the boiling
point. Covering the pot with a lid will speed up the process. When the
water boild, add the pasta and stir. Keep stirring at regular
intervals, otherwise the pasta will become sticky. Refer to the
instructions on the package for cooking time, but be aware that every
kitchen is different, so always check your pasta yourself by taking
out some and tasting its texture. Deciding when the pasta is done is
tricky and also a matter of personal taste. The safe choice is to take
out the pasta when it's *al dente* (lit. *to the tooth*, the phrase
doesn't make any sense), that is, not completely soft and gummy while
not anymore crunchy.

Drain the pasta, add the sugo and serve. Grated *parmigiano* cheese goes very
well on top of pastasciutta, but not everybody likes it, so bring it
to the table for your guests to add it by themselves.
