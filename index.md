I am an assistant professor in the [Content-Centered Computing group](http://beta.di.unito.it/index.php/english/research/groups/content-centered-computing/people) at University of Turin.

Previously, I was a postdoc research fellow in the [Wimmics](http://wimmics.inria.fr/) team of [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr), and before that a PhD candidate at [Center for Language and Cognition Groningen](http://www.let.rug.nl/clcg/), [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/).

My research interests include:

* Computational Semantics
* Language Resources
* Semantic Web
* Natural Language Generation
* Information Extraction
* Linguistic Annotation
* Distributional Semantics
* General Knowledge Bases
* Gamification
* Social Media
* Sentiment Analysis
* Legal Informatics
* Argument Mining
* Hate Speech and abusive language

I like math, videogames, <del>beer</del> pasta, and Oxford commas :)
