title: Going South
---

I moved to the beautiful hills of [Sophia
Antipholis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) to join
the [Wimmics](http://wimmics.inria.fr/) team of [INRIA](www.inria.fr).

This is a major change in my working and private life! I will mostly
work on the ALOOF project, dealing with learning object
representations and relations for domestic robots.
